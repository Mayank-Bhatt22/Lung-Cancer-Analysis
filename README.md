# Lung-Cancer-Analysis
Lung cancer remains one of the most critical global health concerns, with high mortality rates and a strong correlation to smoking and environmental factors. This analysis explores key risk factors, patient demographics, smoking habits, and survival outcomes.
Lung Cancer Analysis
📌 Project Overview
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with smoking, air pollution, and other environmental factors playing a significant role in its prevalence. This project analyzes various risk factors, patient demographics, smoking habits, survival rates, and treatment effectiveness using Power BI to visualize key insights.

📊 Key Objectives
Understand the impact of smoking and passive smoking on lung cancer cases.
Analyze air pollution exposure and its correlation with lung cancer diagnosis.
Evaluate treatment types (Chemotherapy, Surgery, Radiotherapy) and their effectiveness.
Study early detection rates and survival trends based on cancer stages.
Compare lung cancer prevalence across developed and developing countries.
📈 Key Insights
Smoking is a major risk factor – 69.25% of lung cancer patients are smokers.
Early detection is critically low (2%), leading to late-stage diagnoses and lower survival chances.
Average survival duration is 0.20 years, with radiotherapy showing slightly better outcomes.
Developing countries show higher prevalence rates, likely due to pollution and limited healthcare access.
